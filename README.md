# Jev Voice Browser

Speak to your browser. Your words are transcribed live, **TypeSafe's Jev** decides what
you meant, and a Playwright-driven Chromium does it — streamed back into the web app in
realtime.

> “open wikipedia dot org” · “click on pricing” · “type hello world in the search box and
> press enter” · “scroll to the bottom” · “go back”

## Why Jev, and how it's used

[Jev](https://typesafe.ai) is a *System One* model: instead of generating text it returns
**typed decisions** — a `choice` among options you define (with a probability for every
option and a confidence), a yes/no `noul` probability, or a `score` on a rubric. It answers
in roughly 100 ms, which is what makes hands-free browser control feel instant.

Because Jev never generates strings, the split of work is deliberate
(`server/decide.ts`):

| Job | Who | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Find URLs / text to type in the transcript | code | regexes over the normalized speech (“google dot com” → `google.com`) |
| What does the user want? | Jev `choice` | `intent` over `open_url, search_web, click, type_text, press_enter, scroll, go_back, …, unclear` |
| Which thing on the page? | Jev `choice` | every visible interactive element becomes an option `e0…eN` with a compact description, plus an explicit `none` (the docs' *semantic find* pattern; ≤255 options) |
| Submit after typing? | Jev `noul` | `submit_after_typing` |
| Is this hard to undo? | Jev `noul` | `risky` — buy / delete / send / post → the app asks you to confirm |
| Which of several spoken URLs? | Jev `choice` | `url_pick`, only when the sentence contains more than one |
| Act | code | Playwright click / fill / goto / scroll with confidence gates |

All questions go in **one** `POST /v1/systemone` request (speculative fan-out); code reads
only the answers the chosen intent needs. Confidence below `THRESHOLDS.target` turns a
click into a “which one did you mean?” prompt with the top alternatives; you can answer by
voice (“the second one”) or by clicking a chip.

Without a `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` the exact same pipeline runs on keyword heuristics
(`decideHeuristically`) so you can try the UI first — the header pill tells you which mode
is active, and every log entry shows the source, intent confidence, latency and token
usage.

## Run it

Requirements: Node 20+, Chrome or Edge for voice input (the Web Speech API), a TypeSafe
API key (optional but recommended).

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium      # once; skip if Playwright's Chromium is already present
cp .env.example .env                  # add TYPESAFE_API_KEY=...
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)   # or use your shell's dotenv of choice
npm start                             # http://localhost:3000
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> in Chrome, press the mic (or the space bar), and talk. The
controlled browser starts on a built-in demo site at `/demo`; say “open …” to go anywhere.
Set `HEADLESS=false` to also see the real Chromium window, and `START_URL` to start
elsewhere.

Microphone access needs a secure context: `http://localhost` or `https://`. Only *final*
transcripts are sent to the server; interim text is displayed but never acted on.

## Project layout

```
server/
  index.ts     HTTP + WebSocket server, command queue, confirm/clarify state, screenshot stream
  decide.ts    Jev request builder, answer interpretation, thresholds, heuristic fallback
  commands.ts  speech normalization and verbatim extraction (URLs, text to type, yes/no, ordinals)
  elements.ts  in-page script that lists interactive elements → Jev choice options
  browser.ts   Playwright session: snapshot, screenshot, execute(Action)
  actions.ts   the Action union the browser can execute
  protocol.ts  WebSocket message types shared with the UI
  demo.ts      the local demo site
public/        the web app (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, Web Speech API)
test/          vitest unit tests (pure logic + Jev client with a mocked fetch)
```

```bash
npm test          # unit tests
npm run typecheck
```

## Safety model

- Jev only ever picks from **observed** elements and pre-parsed spans; it cannot invent a
  selector, URL or string.
- Actions the `risky` question flags (≥ 0.6) wait for a spoken or clicked confirmation.
  Navigation and scrolling are never gated.
- Page text is data, not instructions: it only appears as option descriptions.
- The controlled browser is a fresh Playwright profile; nothing from your own browser is
  shared with it.

## Notes & limits

- Voice input relies on the browser's Web Speech API (Chrome/Edge). Firefox and Safari can
  still drive everything from the text box.
- Jev 1.13 reads literally and is weaker on numbers and multi-hop reasoning (see the docs'
  jaggedness page), so all counting, arithmetic and string handling stay in code.
- `playwright` is pinned to 1.56.x to match a pre-installed Chromium; bump freely and
  re-run `npx playwright install chromium`.
